# 🛡️ Security Controls and Compliance Management Across AWS

This guide summarizes how to establish, monitor, and enforce **security controls** and **compliance management** in a real-world AWS environment.

---

## 🔒 1. Establish a Strong Security Foundation

### 🏢 AWS Organizations + Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- Centralize account management using **AWS Organizations**.
- Use **SCPs** to enforce guardrails across all accounts.
- Example SCP to prevent deletion of CloudTrail:
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "DenyCloudTrailDelete",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Action": "cloudtrail:DeleteTrail",
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }




👤 IAM Best Practices
---

Enforce least privilege access.

Use IAM roles instead of long-term credentials.

Enable MFA for all users.

Rotate access keys automatically using AWS Config or CI/CD checks.

Detect public access with IAM Access Analyzer.

🧰 2. Continuous Monitoring & Auditing
🪶 AWS CloudTrail

Enable organization-wide trails in all regions.

Store logs in S3 (SSE-KMS encrypted).

Stream to CloudWatch Logs for alerting on key events like ConsoleLogin or DeleteTrail.

🧩 AWS Config

Continuously track configuration changes.

Enable Conformance Packs (e.g., CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark).

Add custom Lambda rules for advanced compliance checks.

🛠️ AWS Security Hub

Centralize findings from GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, Config, etc.

Enable compliance standards:

CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark

NIST 800-53

PCI DSS

Forward findings to SIEM tools (Splunk, Datadog, ELK, etc).

⚔️ 3. Threat Detection & Response
🚨 Amazon GuardDuty

Detects anomalies in VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, and DNS logs.

Alerts on compromised instances, crypto-mining, or exfiltration.

🔍 AWS Inspector

Scans EC2, ECR, and Lambda for vulnerabilities.

Reassesses automatically after deployments.

🔐 Amazon Macie

Scans S3 buckets for PII and sensitive data.

Detects and enforces encryption or access controls.

🧱 4. Network Security Controls

Use private subnets for internal workloads.

Apply Security Groups and NACLs with least privilege.

Route all outbound traffic through NAT Gateway or firewall appliances.

Protect web apps with:

AWS WAF for OWASP Top 10 threats.

AWS Shield Advanced for DDoS mitigation.

🗝️ 5. Data Protection & Encryption

Enforce encryption at rest and in transit.

Use KMS for key management.

Enforce S3 encryption policies.

Manage credentials with Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.

Encrypt all RDS, EBS, and S3 data by default.

🧮 6. Compliance Management in Real-Time
📜 AWS Audit Manager

Map AWS configurations to compliance frameworks like:

GDPR

SOC 2

HIPAA

ISO 27001

Generate automated evidence reports.

⚙️ AWS Config Conformance Packs

Deploy pre-built packs for:

AWSControlTowerBaseline

OperationalBestPractices

PCI-DSS

Automate remediation with Systems Manager Automation Documents (SSM Docs).

🔁 7. Real-Time Enforcement & Auto-Remediation

Example: Enforce S3 Encryption

AWS Config Rule detects unencrypted bucket.

EventBridge Rule triggers on non-compliance.

Lambda Function enables encryption or sends Slack/Teams alert.

This creates a self-healing compliance posture.

🧠 8. Centralized Security Operations

Use AWS Security Lake or export findings to a SIEM.

Correlate AWS events with on-prem or multi-cloud logs.

Example Flow:

GuardDuty → Security Hub → EventBridge → Kinesis Firehose → SIEM (e.g., Splunk/ELK)

📊 9. Dashboards & Reporting

Use QuickSight or Grafana to visualize:

Non-compliant resources

Severity trends

Compliance score

Send daily/weekly reports via SNS or email to security teams.

⚙️ 10. Automation & CI/CD Integration

Integrate security into CI/CD pipelines:

AWS CodePipeline + Inspector for pre-deployment scans.

Trivy or Checkov for IaC scanning.

OPA or Terraform Sentinel for policy enforcement.

Enforce compliance before infrastructure is deployed.

🧩 Real-Time Security Architecture Summary
Layer	AWS Service	Purpose
Governance	Organizations + SCPs	Prevent misconfigurations
IAM	IAM, Access Analyzer	Enforce least privilege
Logging	CloudTrail, Config	Track and audit changes
Threat Detection	GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie	Real-time threat visibility
Compliance	Security Hub, Audit Manager	Continuous compliance
Automation	Lambda, EventBridge	Auto-remediation
Reporting	QuickSight, Security Hub Dashboards	Compliance reporting
🧭 Recommended Workflow

Define baseline controls (CIS, NIST).

Deploy AWS Config + Security Hub.

Integrate findings into SIEM/Security Lake.

Automate remediation with Lambda.

Continuously monitor compliance via dashboards.

✅ Outcome

Continuous visibility into security posture.

Automatic remediation of non-compliant resources.

Simplified audit readiness for frameworks like CIS, PCI, and NIST.

Reduced human error through automation-first compliance.
